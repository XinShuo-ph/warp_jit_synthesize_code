# Milestone 1 Tasks: Reproduce & Analyze CPU Baseline

## Task 1: Select and Import Base Code
- [x] Step 1.1: Read `branch_progresses.md` to confirm best branch.
- [x] Step 1.2: Checkout/copy `code/` directory from selected branch to `code/`.
- **Done when**: `code/` contains `synthesis/`, `extraction/`, etc., and files are present.

## Task 2: Verify CPU Execution
- [x] Step 2.1: Install dependencies (`warp-lang`).
- [ ] Step 2.2: Run pipeline to generate a few samples on CPU.
- **Done when**: Pipeline runs without error and generates JSON output.

## Task 3: Analyze for CUDA
- [ ] Step 3.1: Identify where `device` is hardcoded or defaulted to "cpu".
- [ ] Step 3.2: Create `notes/cpu_baseline.md` with findings.
- **Done when**: Analysis document exists and lists specific files/functions to modify.
