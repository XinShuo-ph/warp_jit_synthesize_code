# Milestone 1 Tasks

## Task 1: Install Warp
- [x] Step 1.1: Check if warp-lang is available
- [x] Step 1.2: Install warp-lang package
- [x] Step 1.3: Verify installation with `import warp`
- **Done when**: Can import warp without errors

## Task 2: Run Basic Examples
- [x] Step 2.1: Clone/access warp repository examples
- [x] Step 2.2: Run first example (simple kernel)
- [x] Step 2.3: Run second example (array operations)
- [x] Step 2.4: Run third example (more complex kernel)
- **Done when**: 3+ examples run successfully without errors

## Task 3: Understand Kernel Compilation
- [x] Step 3.1: Study how kernels are defined with @wp.kernel
- [x] Step 3.2: Trace kernel compilation flow in warp.context
- [x] Step 3.3: Identify where IR is generated
- [x] Step 3.4: Document findings
- **Done when**: `notes/warp_basics.md` created with kernel compilation flow (max 50 lines)

## Task 4: Verification
- [x] Step 4.1: Re-run all examples to confirm repeatability
- [x] Step 4.2: Verify all deliverables are present
- **Done when**: All examples run twice with consistent results
