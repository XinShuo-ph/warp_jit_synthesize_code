# Current State
- **Milestone**: M3 (Scale Up)
- **Status**: in_progress

## Completed
- M1: CPU Code Production (Initial sample + 10k batch).
- M2: CUDA Code Production (Initial sample + 10k batch).
- M3: Report (Written).
- Configured Git LFS for large dataset files.
- Implemented batched generation to avoid file count limits.
- Pushed ~60MB of data to remote.

## Next Action
Continue scaling up to reach 200MB target if needed (requires ~7 more batches of 10k).
