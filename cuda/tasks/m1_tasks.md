# Milestone 1 Tasks: Baseline Reproduction

## Task 1: Select Base Branch
- [ ] List all `cursor/agent-work-merge-process-*` branches.
- [ ] Inspect `git log` and file structure of top candidates.
- [ ] Select one branch as the base.
- **Done when**: A branch is selected and rationale recorded in `cuda/notes/m1_selection.md`.

## Task 2: Import Code
- [ ] Checkout selected branch files into `cuda/code/`.
- [ ] clean up unnecessary files if any.
- **Done when**: `cuda/code/` contains the working CPU implementation.

## Task 3: Verify CPU Baseline
- [ ] Install dependencies (if needed/possible).
- [ ] Run existing tests/pipeline on CPU.
- [ ] Document how to run it in `cuda/tasks/m1_reproduction.md`.
- **Done when**: Code runs successfully on CPU in the current environment.
