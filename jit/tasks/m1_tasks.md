# Milestone 1 Tasks

## Task 1: Environment Setup
- [x] Step 1.1: Install `warp-lang` and dependencies.
- [x] Step 1.2: Verify installation by importing `warp` in python.
- **Done when**: `import warp` runs without error in a python script.

## Task 2: Run Examples
- [x] Step 2.1: Locate or create a simple "Hello World" style warp kernel.
- [x] Step 2.2: Run a physics example (e.g. bounce or similar simple simulation).
- [x] Step 2.3: Run a third example (different kernel type).
- **Done when**: 3 distinct warp examples execute successfully and produce expected output.

## Task 3: Understand Kernel Compilation
- [x] Step 3.1: Investigate `warp` caching and compilation intermediate files.
- [x] Step 3.2: Identify where IR (Intermediate Representation) is generated/stored.
- [x] Step 3.3: Write `jit/notes/warp_basics.md` summarizing findings.
- **Done when**: `jit/notes/warp_basics.md` exists and explains kernel compilation flow and IR location.
