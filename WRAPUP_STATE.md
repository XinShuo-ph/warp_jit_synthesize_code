# Wrapup State
- **Phase**: P3
- **Task**: GPU Analysis
- **Status**: completed

## Next Action
All phases complete. Ready for commit.

## Validation Summary (P1 Complete)
- ✓ warp-lang 1.10.1 installed
- ✓ IR extractor runs successfully
- ✓ Pipeline generates 5/5 samples without errors
- ✓ Dataset validation: 30/30 samples pass
- ✓ Dataset analysis: 770 samples, 5.9 MB, 469 unique kernels
- Minor: Error handling test doesn't raise expected error (non-blocking)

## Documentation Summary (P2 Complete)
- ✓ README.md updated to follow wrapup template
- ✓ Includes progress summary, quick start, file structure
- ✓ Documents data format and known issues

## GPU Analysis Summary (P3 Complete)
- ✓ Created notes/gpu_analysis.md
- ✓ Documented CPU vs GPU IR differences
- ✓ Listed changes needed for CUDA support
- ✓ No GPU available in environment - analysis based on code review
- ✓ Extractor already partially GPU-ready (handles .cu files)
